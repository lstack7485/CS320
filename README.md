How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Input validation is a good start to ensure your code is secure.  You can also make security privileges for users.  This was users don’t have the access to edit your code.  Error logging is another big one.  This ensures you can see when unexpected crashes happen and you can make sure there isn’t someone trying to break into your program.  

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Actively collecting user feedback throughout the development process helps you understand the users needs.  Prioritization of those needs is important too.  You don’t want to waste time fixing something that can wait until the end.  Regular reviews of the program can help facilitate user feedback too.  This way the user is actively engaged in the development process.  

How do I approach designing software?
First I would create a plan for the development of the program.  We need to be able to visualize the structure,  components and their interactions to fully understand what we are trying to program.   I would make sure these requirements were maintainable and can scale.  Scaling helps determine how the system will handle an increased load and usage.  This will make sure the program can grow or shrink to meet changing demands.
